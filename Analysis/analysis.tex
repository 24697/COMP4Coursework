\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Client Identification}
My Client is Team Cambridge Cycling Club, they have been established for 25 years and run cycling event around Cambridge. However the end user of my project will be Paul Millard who is the Racing Secretary for Team Cambridge, He uses computers daily for his work, he also created the club website, also he maintains the current database that hold the results of each even the club holds. Currently he uses and ASUS laptop running Windows Vista 32 bit. For each event that Team Cambridge holds club members are entered in competitions 
\subsection{Define the current system}
Each year Team Cambridge run 24 events on average, the results from these event are recorded on paper by the time keepers, after the event finishes Paul enter the results in to an excel spread sheet, some variables need to be manually looked up and added to the spread sheet such as personal best. The spread sheet then calculates the handy cap time of each rider, then the handicap times are sorted in increasing order and points are awarded on a riders handicap time.
